=Dependencies=
- IUP version 3.3 or 3.4 http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/
  Optional, edit makefile to build without iup gui support
- Lua version 5.1 http://www.lua.org/
- LibUSB (libusb-win32 on windows)
- CHDK source for PTP protocol header http://tools.assembla.com/chdk/browser/trunk

=Windows development environment=
Mingw with gcc 4.5+ is the primary development environment. 
All instructions below assume you are using this.
Using an mingw bash shell for development is suggested.

==Installing mingw==
http://www.mingw.org/
Download the gui installer. Install at least mingw C compiler. Msys is suggested, and may be required
E.g. http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/mingw-get-inst/mingw-get-inst-20101030/

==Installing IUP libraries==
Get the mingw4 binary package of IUP, 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/iup/files/3.3/Windows%20Libraries/
file iup-3.3_Win32_mingw4_lib.zip

Note, this package has the libraries in the root, with etc/ and include/ subdirectories.
You may want to put the libraries in /lib to match the IUP recommended filesystem layout
The examples and win32 binaries are not required, but may be helpful

==Installing and building Lua==
Get the lua 5.1.4 source from http://www.lua.org/download.html
In a msys shell, go to the lua directory and type
make mingw
make local

==Installing LibUSB development package==
TODO
describe filter driver installation
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32/files/libusb-win32-releases/1.2.2.0/
libusb-win32-bin-1.2.2.0.zip
Unzip somewhere convenient
or is it libusb-win32-devel-filter-1.2.2.0.exe ?

=Linux development environment=
The following is based on Ubuntu 10.04, 64 bit. YMMV
Install the following packages and any required dependencies 
libusb-1.0-0
libusb-dev (may be called libusb-1.0-dev ?)
liblua5.1-0-dev
liblua5.1-0

IUP - using precompiled binaries
Download the appropriate IUP library for your platform from 
http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/
unpack the package
adjust the IUP_LIB_DIR and IUP_INCLUDE_DIR in config.mk

You will also need a fully working gcc environment.

=Configuring the source (all platforms)=
Edit config.mk to reflect the installation directories of the above packages
See config-sample-*.mk for examples
