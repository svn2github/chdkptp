chdkptp supports console CLI, a GUI, and batch operation.

The gui is not currently very useful

=Command line=
The interface is selected by command line options
Usage: chdkptp [options]
Options:
  -g    start gui
  -i    start interactive cli
  -c    connect at startup, with optional device spec e.g. -c"-d001 -bbus-0"
  -n    non-interactive - quit after processing command line options (default)
  -e    execute cli command, multiple allowed, e.g -e"u DISKBOOT.BIN" -ereboot
  -h    help

=CLI=
CLI commands are available from the console, gui and the command line

==CLI parsing==
The cli commands lua, luar, exec and putm all accept a single line of free-form text
and pass it unmodified to the underlying function.

Most other commands parse the remaining input into switches and arguments
Switches are in the for -switchname and may take values with -switch=value
Arguments are any other sequence of non-space or quoted characters.

Both switches and words may be quoted as follows:
The characters " or ' can be used to quote arguments or switch values that contain spaces
Inside double quotes "",  backslash \ is treated as an escape character.

==Command reference==
output of help -v
help (h)     [cmd]|[-v]  : - help on [cmd] or all commands
 help -v gives full help on all commands, otherwise as summary is printed

#                        : - comment
exec (!)     <lua code>  : - execute local lua
 Execute lua in chdkptp.
 The global variable con accesses the current CLI connection.
 Return values are printed in the console.

quit (q)                 : - quit program
lua (.)      <lua code>  : - execute remote lua
 Execute Lua code on the camera.
 Returns immediately after the script is started.
 Return values or error messages can be retrieved with getm after the script is completed.

getm                     : - get messages
putm         <msg string>: - send message
luar (=)     <lua code>  : - execute remote lua, wait for result
 Execute Lua code on the camera, waiting for the script to end.
 Return values or error messages are printed after the script completes.

rmem         <address> [count]: - read memory
list                     : - list devices
 Lists all recognized PTP devices in the following format
  <status><num><modelname> b=<bus> d=<device> v=<usb vendor> p=<usb pid> s=<serial number>
 status values
  * connected, current target for CLI commands (con global variable)
  + connected, not CLI target
  - not connected
 serial numbers are not available from all models

upload (u)   [-nolua] <local> [remote]: - upload a file to the camera
 <local>  file to upload
 [remote] destination
   If not specified, file is uploaded to A/
   If remote is a directory or ends in / uploaded to remote/<local file name>
 -nolua   skip lua based checks on remote
   Allows upload while running script
   Prevents detecting if remote is a directory
 Some cameras have problems with paths > 32 characters
 Dryos cameras do not handle non 8.3 filenames well

download (d) [-nolua] <remote> [local]: - download a file from the camera
 <remote> file to download
        A/ is prepended if not present
 [local]  destination
   If not specified, the file will be downloaded to the current directory
   If a directory, the file will be downloaded into it
 -nolua   skip lua based checks on remote
   Allows download while running script

mdownload (mdl) [options] <remote, remote, ...> <target dir>: - download file/directories from the camera
 <remote...> files/directories to download
 <target dir> directory to download into
 options:
   -fmatch=<pattern> download only file with names matching <pattern>
   -dmatch=<pattern> only create directories with names matching <pattern>
   -rmatch=<pattern> only recurse into directories with names matching <pattern>
   -nodirs           only create directories
   -maxdepth=n       only recurse into N levels of directory
 note <pattern> is a lua pattern, not a filesystem glob like *.JPG

mupload (mup) [options] <local, local, ...> <target dir>: - upload file/directories to the camera
 <local...> files/directories to upload
 <target dir> directory to upload into
 options:
   -fmatch=<pattern> upload only file with names matching <pattern>
   -dmatch=<pattern> only create directories with names matching <pattern>
   -rmatch=<pattern> only recurse into directories with names matching <pattern>
   -nodirs           only create directories
   -maxdepth=n       only recurse into N levels of directory
   -pretend          print actions instead of doing them
 note <pattern> is a lua pattern, not a filesystem glob like *.JPG

delete (rm)  [options] <target, target,...>: - delete file/directories from the camera
 <target...> files/directories to remote
 options:
   -fmatch=<pattern> upload only file with names matching <pattern>
   -dmatch=<pattern> only delete directories with names matching <pattern>
   -rmatch=<pattern> only recurse into directories with names matching <pattern>
   -nodirs           don't delete drictories recursed into, only files
   -maxdepth=n       only recurse into N levels of directory
   -pretend          print actions instead of doing them
   -ignore_errors    don't abort if delete fails, continue to next item
   -skip_topdirs     don't delete directories given in command line, only contents
 note <pattern> is a lua pattern, not a filesystem glob like *.JPG

mkdir        <directory> : - create directories on camera
 <directory> directory to create. Intermediate directories will be created as needed

version (ver)             : - print API versions
connect (c)  [-b=<bus>] [-d=<dev>] [-p=<pid>] [-s=<serial>] [model] : - connect to device
 If no options are given, connects to the first available device.
 <pid> is the USB product ID, as a decimal or hexadecimal number.
 All other options are treated as a Lua pattern. For alphanumerics, this is a case sensitive substring match.
 If the serial or model are specified, a temporary connection will be made to each device
 If <model> includes spaces, it must be quoted.
 If multiple devices match, the first matching device will be connected.

reconnect (r)             : - reconnect to current device
disconnect (dis)             : - disconnect from device
ls           [-l] [path] : - list files/directories on camera
reboot       [file]      : - reboot the camera
 [file] is an optional file to boot.
  If not given, the normal boot process is used.
  The file may be an unencoded binary or on DryOS only, an encoded .FI2
 chdkptp attempts to reconnect to the camera after it boots.

=Examples=
start chdkptp in interactive mode and connect to the camera
 chdkptp -i -c

execute lua on host PC and print the result
con> !return 1+1
=2

execute lua on the camera, and print the result
con> =return get_buildinfo()
1:return:table:{platformid=12732,platform="d10",version="CHDK",platsub="100a",build_number="0.9.9",os="dryos",build_date="May  3 2011",build_time="20:54:20",}

upload diskboot.bin to A/diskboot.bin, reboot camera, enter interactive mode
 chdkptp -c -e"u bin/diskboot.bin" -ereboot -i

upload interval.lua to A/CHDK/SCRIPTS/interval.lua, from the command line
 chdkptp -c -e"u interval.lua CHDK/SCRIPTS/"

download A/CHDK/CCHDK.CFG to BACKUP.CFG in the current directory
 chdkptp -c -e"d CHDK/CCHDK.CFG BACKUP.CFG"

connect to the device with name containing D10 on bus "bus-0", 
 chdkptp -c"D10 -b:bus%-0" -i
note connect -b takes a lua pattern, so % is needed to escapes the -

download some jpeg images (in 100CANON etc folders)
con> mdl -fmatch:%.JPG$ DCIM C:\temp

delete some raw images
con> rm -nodirs -fmatch:%.CRW$ DCIM

upload some scripts
con> mup c:\CHDK\SCRIPTS CHDK/SCRIPTS

ad hoc scripting on PC side - download some files
con> !t=con:listdir('A/DCIM/100CANON',{match="%.JPG$"})
con> !for i,n in ipairs(t) do con:download("A/DCIM/100CANON/"..n,"C:/TEMP/"..n) end
note the mdownload cli command above is probably more convenient

list devices and connect to a specific camera

=Running under linux=
Under linux, the .lua files will not automatically found relative to the executable directory
You can set LUA_PATH on the command line to allow them to be located:
$ LUA_PATH="/path/to/chdkptp/lua/?.lua" /path/to/chdkptp ...

Similarly, if you have built IUP and not installed the libraries to the system lib directory,
you must also set LD_LIBARARY_PATH
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/iup LUA_PATH="/path/to/chdkptp/lua/?.lua" /path/to/chdkptp -g

This can be done in a shell script, see chdkptp-sample.sh
