chdkptp supports console CLI, a GUI, and batch operation.

The gui is still unfinished

=Command line=
The interface is selected by command line options
Usage: chdkptp [options]
Options:
 -g  start GUI - default if GUI available and no options given
 -i  start interactive cli
 -c  connect at startup, with optional device spec e.g. -c"-d001 -bbus-0"
 -e  execute cli command, multiple allowed, e.g -e"u DISKBOOT.BIN" -ereboot
 -h  help

If invoked with no options, the GUI will be started if available.  Otherwise,
the CLI will be started.

If started with options and neither -g nor -i is given, chdkptp will run in
batch mode, exiting after performing the actions specified by in the options

When using -e or -c, you must quote any arguments that include spaces

=CLI=
CLI commands are available from the console, gui and the command line

==CLI parsing==
The cli commands lua, luar, exec and putm all accept a single line of free-form
text and pass it unmodified to the underlying function.

Most other commands parse the remaining input into switches and arguments
Switches are in the for -switchname and may take values with -switch=value
Arguments are any other sequence of non-space or quoted characters.

Both switches and words may be quoted as follows:
The characters " or ' can be used to quote arguments or switch values that
contain spaces. Inside double quotes "",  backslash \ is treated as an escape
character.

==Command reference==
output of help -v
help (h)     [cmd]|[-v]  : - help on [cmd] or all commands
 help -v gives full help on all commands, otherwise as summary is printed

#                        : - comment
exec (!)     <lua code>  : - execute local lua

 Return values or error messages can be retrieved with getm after the script is completed.

getm                     : - get messages
putm         <msg string>: - send message
luar (=)     <lua code>  : - execute remote lua, wait for result
 Execute Lua code on the camera, waiting for the script to end.
 Return values or error messages are printed after the script completes.

 serial numbers are not available from all models

upload (u)   [-nolua] <local> [remote]: - upload a file to the camera
 <local>  file to upload
 [remote] destination
   If not specified, file is uploaded to A/
   If remote is a directory or ends in / uploaded to remote/<local file name>
 -nolua   skip lua based checks on remote

   Prevents detecting if remote is a directory
 Some cameras have problems with paths > 32 characters
 Dryos cameras do not handle non 8.3 filenames well

 <remote> file to download
        A/ is prepended if not present
 [local]  destination

 If no options are given, connects to the first available device.
 <pid> is the USB product ID, as a decimal or hexadecimal number.
 All other options are treated as a Lua pattern. For alphanumerics, this is a case sensitive substring match.
 If the serial or model are specified, a temporary connection will be made to each device

=Examples=
start chdkptp in interactive mode and connect to the camera
 chdkptp -i -c

execute lua on host PC and print the result
con> !return 1+1
=2

execute lua on the camera, and print the result
con> =return get_buildinfo()
1:return:table:{platformid=12732,platform="d10",version="CHDK",platsub="100a",build_number="0.9.9",os="dryos",build_date="May  3 2011",build_time="20:54:20",}

upload diskboot.bin to A/diskboot.bin, reboot camera, enter interactive mode
 chdkptp -c -e"u bin/diskboot.bin" -ereboot -i

upload interval.lua to A/CHDK/SCRIPTS/interval.lua, from the command line
 chdkptp -c -e"u interval.lua CHDK/SCRIPTS/"

download A/CHDK/CCHDK.CFG to BACKUP.CFG in the current directory
 chdkptp -c -e"d CHDK/CCHDK.CFG BACKUP.CFG"

connect to the device with name containing D10 on bus "bus-0", 
 chdkptp -c"D10 -b=bus%-0" -i
note connect -b takes a lua pattern, so % is needed to escapes the -

download some jpeg images (in 100CANON etc folders)
con> mdl -fmatch=%.JPG$ DCIM C:\temp

delete some raw images
con> rm -nodirs -fmatch=%.CRW$ DCIM

upload some scripts
con> mup c:\CHDK\SCRIPTS CHDK/SCRIPTS

ad hoc scripting on PC side - download some files
con> !t=con:listdir('A/DCIM/100CANON',{match="%.JPG$"})
con> !for i,n in ipairs(t) do con:download("A/DCIM/100CANON/"..n,"C:/TEMP/"..n) end
note the mdownload cli command above is probably more convenient

list devices and connect to a specific camera

=Running under linux=
Under linux, the .lua files will not automatically found relative to the
executable directory You can set LUA_PATH on the command line to allow them
to be located:
$ LUA_PATH="/path/to/chdkptp/lua/?.lua" /path/to/chdkptp ...

Similarly, if the IUP and CD shared libraries are not on the default system path,
you must also set LD_LIBARARY_PATH
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/iup LUA_PATH="/path/to/chdkptp/lua/?.lua" /path/to/chdkptp -g

This can be done in a shell script, see chdkptp-sample.sh
